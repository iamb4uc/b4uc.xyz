People who know me know that I am against fapping, first of all, "Yes I am unappologetically against fapping". This is not some religious bullshit or anyting, its just something I overcame and build my personal self over. So, why am I against fapping or any form of distraction and "over the top fantasies" (**its ok to have fantasies**).
