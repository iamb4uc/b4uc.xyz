### Why use vim over other text editors and IDEs?
For me, I've always loved minimalism and performance over ease of use and other flashy bloat no one really uses and cares about. This why I personally use Terminal-based text editors. Preferably VIM or NeoVIM. Tho I currently, am running NeoVIM, but both of them are basically the same. NeoVIM is a little bit more extensible than VIM and easy to manage imo. But enough talking, lets start configuring our VIM/NVIM to make it more like an actual developing environment.
